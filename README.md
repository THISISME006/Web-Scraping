## Web-Scraping
Hello, world!

Thanks for viewing my project! 
This is one project of many that was created for the internship evaluation test .


This project is around web-scrapping for the laptop data from the one of the renowned e-commerce platform Flipkart, i scraped the data of 48 different laptops.

I used Jupyter notebook for the test and used libraries like 
## PANDAS - 
a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis, 

## BeautifulSoup -
used for operating with HTML queries and XML queries,

## REQUEST -
a module that allows to send HTTP requests using Python

The goal of this case test is to take data from the e-commerce website and import it into a csv file for future analysis.
